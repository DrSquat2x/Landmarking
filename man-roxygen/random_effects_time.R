#' @param random_effects_time Vector of character strings specifying the column names in \code{data_long}
#' which contain the times at which random effect variables were recorded. This should either be length 1 or
#' the same length as \code{random_effects}. In the latter case the order of elements must correspond to the
#' order of elements in \code{random_effects}.
