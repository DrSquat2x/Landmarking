#' @param predictors_LME_time Vector of character strings specifying the column names in \code{data_long}
#' which contains the time at which the predictor variables were recorded.
#' This should either be length 1 or the same length as `predictors_LME`.
#' In the latter case the order of elements must correspond to the order of elements in `predictors_LME`.
